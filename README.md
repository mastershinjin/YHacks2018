# YHacks2018
my yhacks 2018 project - basically utilizing the smartcar API to create a webapp/service that would allow people to have others move their cars for them as a service...Think Uber but for parking...


---More info later, project still in progress-----


BACKEND DEV:
 -Utilizes a Flask server to communicate between JS and python 
 -Run the python file (app.py) with the appropriate secondary python files (sqlite, etc...) within the SAME FOLDER/PATH
 -Connection should automatically set to be "localhost:8000" (for testing puproses), navigate to individual URI's (such as "localhost:8000/getCarLocation") to achieve desired functionality on any web browser (tested on chrome)
